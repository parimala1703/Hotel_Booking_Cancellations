# Data Analysis using Excel
# Hotel Booking Cancellations Dashboard

## Objective
The goal of this dashboard is to provide an interactive and visually insightful way to monitor hotel booking cancellations, segmented by various factors such as:
- Guest type (couple, family, single)
- Hotel type (city hotel, resort hotel)
- Seasonality
- Room status (desired vs. undesired)
- Cancellation trends

## Setup and Features
This dashboard was created using the following steps and features to provide a comprehensive understanding of booking cancellations:

### Data Preparation and Cleaning
- Removed irrelevant columns and cleaned the data for consistency and clarity.
- Ensured the dataset was free from duplicates and missing values.
- Categorized data into guest types (couple, family, single), room statuses (desired vs. undesired), and hotel types (city hotel, resort hotel).
- Converted data into formats suitable for visualization (e.g., categorizing seasons and booking statuses).

### Data Segmentation
1. **Guest Types**: Segmenting by couple, family, and single.
2. **Hotel Types**: Differentiated between city hotels and resort hotels.
3. **Seasonality**: Analyzed booking patterns across different months and seasons.
4. **Room Status**: Grouped bookings by whether they were assigned the desired or undesired room.

## Dashboard Structure
The dashboard provides an interactive overview with the following features:

### Cancellation Rate Overview
- A line chart or bar chart showing the cancellation rate across different months or seasons. 
- This allows stakeholders to identify trends in cancellations, particularly for peak vs. off-peak seasons.

### Guest Type Segmentation
- A pie chart or bar chart displaying the proportion of cancellations by guest type (couple, family, single).
- This helps in understanding which guest types are more likely to cancel and why.

### Hotel Type Segmentation
- A bar chart or stacked bar chart showing cancellations by hotel type (city hotel vs. resort hotel).
- It highlights whether city hotels or resort hotels experience higher cancellations.

### Room Status Impact
- A heatmap or bar chart showing cancellations based on room status (desired vs. undesired).
- This visualizes whether cancellations are more likely when rooms are not as per the guest’s preferences.

### Seasonal Booking Trends
- A line chart showing bookings and cancellations over the months, segmented by hotel type and guest type.
- This provides an overview of when cancellations peak and how they correlate with seasonal bookings.

### Filters and Slicers
- Interactive filters (such as dropdowns or slicers) to allow users to filter the data by year, hotel type, guest type, and room status.
- This allows users to focus on specific aspects of the data, such as cancellations during certain months or for specific guest types.

## Key Insights
Using the dashboard, the following key insights were derived:

1. **Cancellation Trends**:
   - Peak cancellation rates are observed during certain months (e.g., holidays, off-peak seasons), and this varies significantly between city hotels and resort hotels.
  
2. **Impact of Room Type on Cancellations**:
   - Cancellations are higher when guests are assigned undesired rooms. This indicates a need for better room assignment systems or more flexible booking options.

3. **Guest Type Behavior**:
   - Families and single guests tend to cancel more frequently than couples. This could be due to changes in plans or dissatisfaction with room assignments.

4. **Seasonality**:
   - Resort hotels have higher cancellations during off-peak seasons, while city hotels experience more consistent booking trends throughout the year.

## Business Impact and Recommendations

### 1. Optimizing Room Assignments
- Based on the dashboard’s insights, hotels can optimize room assignment processes to ensure guests receive their desired room types, thereby reducing cancellations.

### 2. Targeted Marketing
- During peak cancellation periods, targeted marketing campaigns can be introduced to reduce cancellations, such as offering special incentives for early booking confirmations.

### 3. Improved Customer Satisfaction
- Understanding guest type and room preferences will help hotels tailor their offerings to meet customer expectations more effectively, increasing retention rates.

### 4. Promotions for Off-Peak Seasons
- To reduce cancellations in off-peak seasons for resort hotels, promotional offers can be targeted at families or singles who are more likely to cancel during these periods.

## Conclusion
The Hotel Booking Cancellations Dashboard provides valuable insights into booking trends and cancellations, helping hotel management teams make informed decisions to reduce cancellations and improve customer satisfaction. By leveraging this dashboard, hotels can optimize their room assignment processes, adjust marketing strategies, and better align their operations with customer preferences.
